## Craft and deploy bulletproof embedded software in Elixir

Nerves provides tooling and libraries for building small, self-contained
software images using the rock-solid [Erlang virtual
machine](https://www.erlang.org/) hardware support of Linux, and happy
development experience of Elixir for microprocessor-based embedded systems.

Our project is spread over many repositories. See [our project
directory](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves#nerves-projects).

If you are new to Nerves, take a look at the
[website](https://nerves-project.org) and our
[documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/).
